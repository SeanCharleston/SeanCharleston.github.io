					<p>Date Oct 2013 – Jan 2014</p>
					<p>Company WaikatoLink Limited</p>
					<p>L.O.B. Agricultural Research and Development</p>
					<p>Position Held: Research Assistant</p>
					<p>Summary</p>
					<p>Upon completion of my Engineering Degree, I undertook a contract as an extension to my honours research project. I was involved with the Chronoptics research group at the University of Waikato, as well as an external company, Farmshed Labs, who specialise in interfacing agriculture with technology.</p>
					<p>This project investigated the use of time-of-flight cameras in the dairy environment. The Chronoptics group’s state of the art algorithms were implemented, in an attempt to correct common drawbacks of time-of-flight technology including multipath interference.</p>
					<p>Some of the key achievements of this contract included reverse engineering a commercial camera’s calibration system, developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB for external testing of software, and calibrating the existing algorithms for practical applications. The ultimate output goals of the project were to produce a management level presentation aimed at large dairy companies, and provide a technical report.</p>
					<p><b>Responsibilities</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reverse engineering a time-of-flight calibration system</li>
						<li>Working independently whilst providing regular contract updates</li>
						<li>Using MATLAB to develop interfaces and image processing programs</li>
						<li>Producing high-level outputs aimed at large corporations</li>

					<p>Company Plant & Food Research</p>
					<p>L.O.B. Agricultural Research and Development</p>
					<p>Position Held: Software and Prototype Developer</p>
					<p>Summary</p>
					<p>For my second Engineering Work Placement I worked on a project to grade various fruits and vegetables. My role was in the software development area of the project using LabVIEW to increase the usability and functionality of software for a LabJack (USB measurement and automation device). This also included integrating an easy way to export data, as well as interfacing new instruments (a flow meter and an injection valve).</p>
					<p>Once this software was operational, I was producing prototypes of the sensing system using the LabVIEW software, as well as running all experiments and maintaining the hardware. I was required to discuss my findings and issues at weekly meetings with other Engineers, Scientists and Team Leaders.</p>
					<p>Towards the end of the placement I gave a presentation to the company, outlining the project goals, achievements and the current limitations.</p>
					<p><b>Responsibilities</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Using LabVIEW to develop software</li>
						<li>Producing prototypes</li>
						<li>Running accurate and repeatable experiments</li>
						<li>Brainstorming problems and ideas with supervisors, senior management, and engineers</li>

					<p>Summary</p>
					<p>I was employed part time during the University semester to begin the development of a project, focused around the detection of moisture in wood. Initially I performed a large amount of research and documentation. I was then involved in reverse engineering aspects of the solution which required troubleshooting and determination. Once the above was complete I was responsible for the initial circuit design and producing of a number concepts for testing.</p>
					<p>I primarily worked autonomously and it was my responsibility to document my findings, complete work and communicate progress to my supervisor. This included weekly reports that outlined required resources for the following week as well as areas of concern to my supervisors.</p>
